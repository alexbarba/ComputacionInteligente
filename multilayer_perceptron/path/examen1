# Override this file with your input values. You can delete the comments, but
# it is important to only left the table lines without a "#" at the beginning.

# Fill the input table following the example, where:
# - n: number of inputs
# - m: number of outputs
# - r: number of known results

# It is important to put a space between values and keep the "|" as a separator
# between inputs and desired outputs (separating with spaces too). Inputs should
# be binary values (0, 1).
